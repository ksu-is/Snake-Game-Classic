# Snake-Game-Classic
This version of 'snake game' will be created in PyGame.
The 'snake' will follow directional commands, and the objective of the game is to prevent the snake from running into obstructions (i.e. the barrier of the game or the snakes body).
A secondary objective is to direct the snake into food, denoted by pixels laying on the field.
Collecting 'food' will increase both the length of the snake and your score
